Currently can translate, scale, and rotate, but line :

gl.uniformMatrix4fv(gl.getUniformLocation(shaderProgram, "projectionMatrix"), gl.FALSE, m.convertToWebGL());

is causing issues where the either the camera is being moved, or all my shapes are being scaled in the x direction.

perspectiveProjection does not appear to be working properly, but orthographicProjection is.

There could be more errors once these are fixed, but these appear to be immediate issues.
